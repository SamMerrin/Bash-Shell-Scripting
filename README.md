# Bash-Shell-Scripting

The purpose of this bash shell script is to update and upgrade Debian-based Linux distros. This script includes clear commentation of each step making it easy to understand and follow along what the script is doing. The script incorporates broken dependencies/partial setups handling, removes unnecessary packages, updates recovery partition, checks for new releases, error handling and logging. This script will prompt you before making any big decisions to re-ensure and confirm upgading steps. 

To create this bash shell script, open up your favorite text editor, like nano for example. Copy and paste this script into your text editor, dont forget the shebang (#!/bin/bash) at the top, and save the script with a .sh extension. Make the script executable by changing the permission of the file using the command "chmod +x _____.sh". You can execute the script in the terminal by putting ./ before the name of the bash file, i.e. ./example.sh.
